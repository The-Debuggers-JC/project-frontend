Website Clone & Responsive Design
======
This is a website cloning project, an exercise for testing our individual **HTML** and **CSS** abilities. It showcases our attempts to replicate the original design and functionality of a working website using our current skillset, while also navigating the challenges and benefits of collaborative coding.

### **HTML**

HTML was employed to establish the structure of the cloned website. This involved using appropriate tags to represent the different sections, elements, and content, mirroring the original site's architecture.

### **CSS**

CSS was used to detail how the HTML elements are displayed and how the website adapts to different screen sizes.
